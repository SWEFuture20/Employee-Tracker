# Employee-Tracker

In this app, I created a database that stores information about employees such as their name, department , and roles at a company. 

## Technologies 

The technology that was used in this app were MySQL, Node, Inquirer to run the information through the terminal. This was great practice to learn back end coding.

Enjoy The App!
